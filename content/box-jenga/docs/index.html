		<h3 id="getstart"><strong>C) Getting Started</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>To run the game you just need to run index.html in the browser via local server like <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/platform/windows.html" target="_blank">Apache</a>, <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/" target="_blank">Xampp</a>, or another one.</p>

		<h3 id="code"><strong>D) Source Code</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			This game contains:
			<ol>
				<li>Phaser 3</li>
				<li>Our custom scripts</li>
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<li>Phaser 3 is a game framework built with JavaScript that allows you to create games using HTML, a little bit of CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
				<li>
					The game has the following JavaScript files:
					<ul>
						<li>./boot.js: this is the main file that preloads assets and initializes the game.</li>
						<li>./config.js: this file contains the game configuration.</li>
						<li>./game_request.js: this file contains requests that manage the user's state.</li>
						<li>./js/game.js: this file is called in <strong>boot.js</strong> and creates all the internal classes and managers.</li>
						<li>./js/game_play/game_play.js: this class is responsible for game logic and gameplay control.</li>
						<li>./js/game_utilities/audio_manager.js: this class manages sound and music control.</li>
						<li>./js/game_utilities/custom_button.js: this class creates an in-game button.</li>
						<li>./js/game_utilities/game_utils.js: this class contains various utility functions.</li>
						<li>./js/game_utilities/social_api.js: this class manages social functions.</li>
						<li>./js/game_utilities/test_ad_manager.js: this class manages test interstitial and rewarded ads.</li>
						<li>./js/game_windows/game_windows.js: this class controls the creation, management, and deletion of windows.</li>
						<li>./js/game_windows/select_language.js: this class creates a window that allows for language selection.</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			Resuming, the complete game flow is the following:
			<ol>
				<li>The index.html file preloads boot.js, config.js and game_request.js.</li>
				<li>Then in boot.js the process of preloading and game initialization starts when the ready event is called.</li>
				<li>After that, game.js starts the process of creating other classes, containers and managers.</li>
				<li>After all the creations, the map scene starts, allowing the player to begin playing.</li>
				<li>
					There is a user data object that defines user progress and behavior. When the user performs any action, a request is sent to update the user data. This data is then updated in <strong>localStorage</strong>. All the requests can be found in <strong>game_request.js</strong>.
					Here is an example of how a request is called when the user finishes a level in the <strong>GamePlay</strong> class:
				</li>
				<img src="assets/images/20.png" alt="request example" />
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h3 id="changegraph"><strong>E) Config</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			The initial configuration can be found in the <strong>index.html</strong> file, and it contains some basic information.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/1.png" alt="loading_vars" />
		<p>
			The <strong>gamedata</strong> object is in <strong>config.js</strong> and contains various social and shop-related components.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/3.png" alt="game data configuration" />
		<p>
			The <strong>userdata</strong> object is in <strong>config.js</strong> and contains information about the user.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/4.png" alt="user data configuration" />
		<p>
			There are also some gameplay config in <strong>config.js</strong>.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/37.png" alt="gameplay config" />
		<h3 id="lang"><strong>F) Language Management</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			There are five languages used in the game: English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian. All of the phrases can be found in <strong>./assets/xml/language.xml</strong>. Each phrase has important attributes: <strong>scene_id</strong>, <strong>item_id</strong>, and <strong>phrase_id</strong>, which are needed to call the phrase in JavaScript. Each phrase contains internal tags responsible for specific languages. Each language tag includes two inner tags: <strong>&lt;TEXT&gt;</strong>, which contains the value, and <strong>&lt;SIZE&gt;</strong>, which specifies the size value (0 by default). For example, setting <strong>-4</strong> will make the phrase smaller by 4 points.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/5.png" alt="phrase example" />
		<p>
			To generate text and set it to the JavaScript Text Object, follow these steps. As shown, you need to call the <strong>game_utils.generate_string</strong> method and provide <strong>scene_id</strong>, <strong>item_id</strong>, <strong>phrase_id</strong>, <strong>values</strong>, and <strong>base_size</strong>. This method returns an object with <strong>text</strong> and <strong>size</strong> fields. You can then create bitmap text and set the result accordingly.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/6.png" alt="generate text" />
		<p>
			I didn't mention the <strong>values</strong> parameter. For example, if you need a phrase with a dynamic result, you should construct your tag as follows: replace the value with <strong>%val</strong>, and then pass the desired value into the <strong>values</strong> array.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/7.png" alt="button" /> <br>
		<img src="assets/images/8.png" alt="phrase example" />
		<img src="assets/images/9.png" alt="phrase example" />
		<p>
			To add a new phrase, simply add a <strong>&lt;DYNAMIC_PHRASE&gt;</strong> tag with three attributes and the necessary inner values and tags. Then, call it in the same way as shown in previous examples.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, you can switch the language during the game by calling the <strong>SelectLanguage</strong> window.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/10.png" alt="select language" />
		<p>
			If you want to remove a language, you should delete its value from the <strong>game_data['langs']</strong> array.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/11.png" alt="remove language" />
		<h3 id="store"><strong>G) Store Config</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			Let's imagine you want to add a new crate skin. To add a new skin to the game, you should:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Add an image, <strong>crate7.png 70x70</strong> (for example) to <strong>content/common1</strong> and recreate the <strong>common1</strong> sprite sheet.</li>
			<li>
				Consider <strong>game_data['shop']</strong> object. There is one category: purchasing by viewing ads. Add an object like <br><code>{'id': 'crate7', 'price': value}</code>
				to the <strong>ad</strong> array.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<img src="assets/images/12.png" alt="shop config" />
		<h3 id="audio"><strong>H) Audio Management</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			Here is path where all sounds and music are located <strong>./assets/audio/</strong> . To call a sound in the game, you should use the following method:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/15.png" alt="sound call" />
		<p>
			If you want to play looped music, use this method:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/16.png" alt="music call" />
		<p>
			If you want to stop all sounds and music, use this method:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/17.png" alt="stop all" />
		<p>
			You can also stop a specific sound or music, though this case is not used in the game. If you want to do this, you should call  <code>game_data['audio_manager'].sound_event({'stop': true, 'sound_type': 'sound' // or 'music'});</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two fields in the userdata object that define the state of music and sounds.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/18.png" alt="user data fields" />
		<p>
			The control of these fields is managed through two methods in the <strong>GameMap</strong> class.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/19.png" alt="music and sound controls" />
		<h3 id="social"><strong>I) Social Api</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			If you decide to publish this game anywhere, you should initialize the social features (rewarded ads, interstitial ads, etc.). Consider using the <strong>SocialApi</strong> class in the <strong>game_utilities/social_api.js</strong> file as the base for your own implementation. Here is an example of a test net ID social class with mock code:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/13.png" alt="YourNetApi" />
		<p>
			Here is the initialization of the <strong>SocialApi</strong> class in the <strong>game.js</strong> file.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/14.png" alt="Social part initialization" />
		<p>
			To call a rewarded ad, you should use the <strong>game_data['utils'].show_rewarded_ad</strong> method. For an example, you can refer to the <strong>Shop</strong> class.
		</p>
		<p>
			To call an interstitial ad, you should use the <strong>game_data['utils'].check_ads</strong> method. For an example, you can refer to the <strong>GamePlay</strong> class.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/28.png" alt="call interstitial" />
		<p>
			In this example, the parameter passed is the string "level_win". To make it clearer, you should consider the <strong>game_data['ads']['interstitial']['event_mult']</strong> object. Here, you can see a key with a float value. This indicates the place in the game where the ad could be called and the probability of it being called (e.g., 1 means the ad will be called every time, while 0.3 means the ad will be called 3 times out of 10 on average).
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/29.png" alt="game_data['ads']['interstitial']['event_mult']" />
		<p>
			To summarize, let's say you want to publish a game on the Y platform with in-app payments, interstitial ads, and rewarded ads.
			The platform will provide its own API. To integrate the game with Y, follow these steps:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Change <strong>loading_vars['net_id']</strong> in the <strong>index.html</strong> file to <strong>'y'</strong> for example.</li>
			<li>Implement a class in <strong>./js/game_utilities/social_api.js</strong> as shown below.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/39.png" alt="" />
			<li>Initialize this class in the <strong>get_social_api</strong> method (<strong>./js/game.js</strong>) as shown below.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/40.png" alt="" />
			<li>If the platform offers cloud storage for saving progress, add code to game_request.js in the <strong>save_user_data</strong> and <strong>get_game_info_local</strong> methods as follows:</li>
			<img src="assets/images/41.png" alt="" />
			<img src="assets/images/42.png" alt="" />
			<li>
				If the platform requires an initialization process, add it to the <strong>initialize</strong> function in <strong>boot.js</strong> as shown below.
			</li>
			<img src="assets/images/43.png" alt="" />
		</ol>
		<h3 id="wnd"><strong>J) Windows Management</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			To display any window, you should call the following:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/21.png" alt="windows call" />
		<p>
			To close this window:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/23.png" alt="windows close" />
		<p>
			If you want to create your own window, you should initialize it in the <strong>display_window</strong> method's <strong>switch case</strong> statement in the <strong>./js/game_windows/game_windows.js</strong> file.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/22.png" alt="windows initializing" />
		<p>
			All window methods, such as <strong>open</strong>, <strong>close</strong>, etc., are located in the <strong>./js/game_windows/game_windows.js</strong> file.
		</p>
		<h3 id="changegraph"><strong>K) Fonts</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			There is one font type used in the game: <strong>Bitmap Font</strong>. It is located in the <strong>assets/fonts/</strong> folder. Here is an example of creating a bitmap text:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/24.png" alt="font" />
		<p>
			To use a bitmap font, you should preload it as done in <strong>boot.js</strong>.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/26.png" alt="font preload" />
		<h3 id="progress"><strong>L) Saving progress</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			The current version uses <strong>localStorage</strong> to save progress.
			If you don't want <strong>localStorage</strong> to save progress, set <strong>game_data['clear_storage'] = true</strong>.
			This logic is implemented in <strong>game_request.js</strong>.
			The <strong>get_game_info_local</strong> method checks if there was previous progress, and if so, it uses that progress.
			The <strong>save_user_data</strong> method saves progress and is called after any request made during the game, such as a <strong>buy_booster</strong> request. If you want to use a different storage method, you need to implement its API in these methods. An example is shown in the Social API section.
		</p>
		<h3 id="changegraph"><strong>M) Change Graphics</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			Most graphics used in the game are taken from the <strong>common1</strong> sprite sheet (<strong>./assets/common1.png</strong>, <strong>./assets/common1.json</strong>). The source graphics are located in <strong>./content/common1/</strong>. You can modify any graphics in <strong>./content/common1/</strong> and rebuild the sprite sheet using the <a href="https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker" target="_blank">TexturePacker</a> tool. Additionally, you can change the background in <strong>./assets/bgs/back1.png</strong> to one of your preference.
		</p>
		<h3 id="bundle"><strong>N) Bundle Build</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			If you set <strong>loading_vars['js_combined']</strong> to true, the preloader will try to get the <strong>bundle.js</strong> file. This is intended for production mode. There are <strong>gulpfile.js</strong> and <strong>package.json</strong> files to build. You should install NPM and then run the following commands:
			<ul>
				<li>npm i</li>
				<li>npm start</li>
			</ul>
			After that, a <strong>js_min</strong> folder will be created, and <strong>boot.js</strong>, <strong>config.js</strong>, <strong>game_request.js</strong>, and <strong>bundle.js</strong> (built from the <strong>js</strong> folder) will be placed there.
		</p>
